		<h2>Programming Club</h2>

		<p class="section-2">Ever since the beginning of my high school journey, I have been a part of the Governing Body of the Programming Club. For me, the Programming Club is like a family and I couldn't have thought of how my life would be had I had not bveen selected. It allowed me to decide my career path permanently, Computer Science. It was in this club that I discovered my knack for programming in general. I have been pushed out of my comfort zone many times while working for the club. Moreover, the experiences I had working there, really solidified how far my goals truly are. Driven more than ever, I had made it my goal to surpass each and everyone of my senior.</p> 
		<p class="section-2">
		I had been thrusted into the position of an instructor on my first week. Ever since then, I could have never imagined how enjoyable it was to teach people and have students become skilled enough to challenge me. Teaching for me was euphoric. Along with that, I was also fond of helping out and simultaneously participating in Intra-School Programming Competitions. These competitions were probably the most enthralling experiences of my life. I had the chance of competing along with my juniors and seniors to find out who truly was the best. All in all, I had been declared the runner-up for the contest held in 2021 and victorious for the one held in 2022.

		<p class="section-2" id="fin">While in Grade 10, I have been responsible for the founding of the Recreational Club. This club was founded while having three societies: the Digital Art Society, the Laugh Out Loud Society and the Poetry Society. This club has been responsible for honing my leadership skills as never before did I have multiple people looking at me for direction and approval. Never had I truly been pushed to the edge by this much, my skills as a leader was truly put to the test. This was also the time when I had to organise a Digital Art Contest and host a guest session in a span of 1 week. At times, you really have to wonder as to how much work it takes to encourage people to continue their hobbies. Encouraging humour, art and poetry has always been our goal and we'll strive to do it no matter how hard it gets for us.</p>
